# The Odin Project 
Starting from today 29/1/24, I'll try my best to spend atleast 1 hour a day studying Full Stack Web Development. Hopefully I manage to complete my task everyday. My end goal with this challenge is to be able to create a dynamic market level full stack website without requiring any help.

I'll be  using the entire course available at The Odin Project : [www.theodinproject.com]. 
For now I've decided to go with the JS workflow but if time permits I'll learn Ruby On Rails as well.
